ASCII
	every character is represented using a number between 32 and 127

till 128 everyone followed ANSI standard, above that there are diffenent system based on the country you live

UNICODE

	every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the unicode consortium
eg:
	U+0041 ----> A and this is just a code point, how it is stored in memory is where endcoding comes into play

'U+' is UNICODE, rest is hexdecimal equivalent

UTF-7,8,16,32
	
	UTF 7, 8, 16, and 32 all have the nice property of being able to store any code point correctly.


Things to remember:
	it does not make sense to have a string without knowing what encoding it uses
	there is no such things as plain text
	If you have a string, in memory, in a file, or in an email message, you have to know what encoding it is in or you cannot interpret it or display it to users correctly.
