Users often take a password that they can remember and try to crowbar it into fitting the password policy.

eg: if mypassword is not allowed, users may try something like Mypassword1! and update them regularly like Mypassword2! and so on

Username enumeration:

is when an attackerr is able to observer changes in the website's behavior in order to indentiy whether a given username is valid.

in registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken... we get that that username is there...

Status codes: if a guess returns a different status code

Error messages: verbose error messages in case of a wrong username

subtible difference: sometimes the loaded page for valid username might be 1or2 chars different from a invalid username, this can be used to infer valid usernames

Response times: a website might check whether the password is correct if the username is valid, this extra step might cause a slight increase in response time, but an attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticebly longer to handle...
