something you know - password
something you have - mobile 

its is possible to bypass the 2fa code if implemented badly

if the OTP is got in next page, youre techincally logged in already, this could be abused

login ---> Enter otp just leave that page open and start a new page, your session will be the victim account, thus you have bypassed the otp

login ---> sets a cookie with username and requests otp, an attacker could brute fore the otp with username set as victim and get their session.
